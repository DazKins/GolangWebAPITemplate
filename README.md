# Go API Example

This repository is an entirely opinionated template of how to build a general purpose web API in [Golang](https://golang.org/).

## Libraries Used

- [`resty`](https://github.com/go-resty/resty) - provides a simple HTTP Client to make request to external services
- [`gorilla/mux`](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) - HTTP router library
- [`dig`](https://github.com/uber-go/dig) - A dependency injection framework from [Uber](https://www.uber.com)

## Still to add

- Unit testing
